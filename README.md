# Titanium dioxide levels in food and other ingested products: a systematic review

# Abstract
In 2021, the European Commission decided to ban titanium dioxide as a food additive
in the European Union due to concerns that it may be harmful to humans when
ingested - a decision expected to be echoed in other regions and industries. The aim of
this systematic review was to gather all available data on the concentration of titanium
dioxide in products contributing to oral exposure of it, namely food, dietary
supplements, pharmaceuticals and certain personal care products. A literature search
in Web of Science, Scopus and Google yielded 55 studies, totaling 674 products
across various categories. A hierarchical Bayesian model was used to estimate the
median concentration in each product category, at four different levels of aggregation.
The overall median concentration was estimated at 597 (502-709) mg/kg, while
estimates across categories ranged between 3 (<1-613) and 2,297 (1,345-3,576)
mg/kg. For individual products, concentrations up to 51,000 mg/kg were found. These
results suggest that titanium dioxide is present in a lot of products available worldwide
and in considerable concentrations. By taking into account multiple routes of exposure,
this review provides a valuable source of information in support of more informed
public health policies that aim to protect consumer safety.
